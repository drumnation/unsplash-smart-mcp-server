### Local Installation (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/drumnation/unsplash-smart-mcp-server.git
cd unsplash-smart-mcp-server
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure your Cursor MCP settings:
   - macOS: Edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
   - Windows: Edit `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json`
   - Linux: Edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

4. Add the following configuration:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "unsplash": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "src/server.ts"],
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/unsplash-smart-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }

}
```

5. Replace:
   - `/absolute/path/to/unsplash-smart-mcp-server` with the actual path where you cloned the repo
   - `your_api_key_here` with your Unsplash API key

6. Save the file and restart Cursor.

> **Important:** Unlike many MCP servers, this server requires direct process piping and cannot be accessed via TCP ports or through npm directly due to how it handles FastMCP's I/O interactions. The local installation method is the most reliable approach.

### Cursor CLI Alternative

If you prefer using Cursor's CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add unsplash npx tsx /path/to/unsplash-smart-mcp-server/src/server.ts --cwd /path/to/unsplash-smart-mcp-server
claude mcp config set unsplash UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Replace the paths and API key with your actual values.

### Via Docker (Most Reliable Method)

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/drumnation/unsplash-smart-mcp-server.git
cd unsplash-smart-mcp-server
```

2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
services:
  unsplash-mcp:
    build: .
    image: unsplash-mcp-server
    restart: always
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
    environment:
      - UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

3. Build and start the container:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Configure your Cursor MCP settings:
   - macOS: Edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
   - Windows: Edit `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json`
   - Linux: Edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

5. Add the following configuration:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "unsplash": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["exec", "-i", "unsplash-mcp-unsplash-mcp-1", "tsx", "src/server.ts"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

6. Save the file and restart Cursor.

This setup will:
- Start the server automatically when Docker starts
- Restart the server if it crashes
- Run in the background without terminal windows
- Provide a reliable connection to Cursor

## üß© Integration with AI Agents

### Step-by-Step Guide for Claude in Cursor

Our Unsplash Smart MCP Server is designed to make image acquisition through AI agents effortless and intuitive:

1. **Initiate a request**: Simply ask Claude for an image in natural language
2. **AI interpretation**: Claude understands your needs and calls the `stock_photo` tool with optimized parameters
3. **Smart image selection**: The server interprets context and finds the most relevant images
4. **Presentation of options**: Claude presents you with the best matches and download commands
5. **Seamless download**: Execute the suggested commands to place images exactly where you need them
6. **Automatic attribution**: All attribution data is stored and can be accessed whenever needed

This process eliminates the traditional workflow of:
1. ~~Searching Unsplash manually~~
2. ~~Scrolling through hundreds of results~~
3. ~~Downloading images to random locations~~
4. ~~Moving files to the correct project folders~~
5. ~~Manually tracking attribution data~~
6. ~~Creating attribution pages~~

### Example Prompts for AI Agents

Ask Claude in Cursor for images using natural language prompts like these:

```
"Find a professional image for a tech startup landing page hero section"
```

## ü™ü Windows Compatibility

If you're using Windows and experiencing the "Client closed" error when running the MCP server in Cursor, follow these special configuration steps:

### Windows-specific MCP Configuration

Create a file named `mcp.json` in your `.cursor` directory (typically at `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json`) with one of these configurations:

#### Option 1: Direct Node Execution (Recommended)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stock_photo": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./node_modules/.bin/tsx", "path/to/unsplash-mcp/src/server.ts"],
      "disabled": false,
      "env": {
        "UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      },
      "shell": false
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 2: PowerShell Approach

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stock_photo": {
      "command": "powershell",
      "args": ["-Command", "npx tsx path/to/unsplash-mcp/src/server.ts"],
      "disabled": false,
      "env": {
        "UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For complete documentation on Windows compatibility, see [Windows Compatibility Guide](./docs/windows-compatibility.md).

## üõ†Ô∏è API Reference

### URL-First Approach: The Smart Choice

Our architecture uses a URL-first approach rather than direct image embedding for several critical reasons:

1. **Storage Efficiency**: Prevents AI agents from unnecessarily storing large binary data in their context
2. **Bandwidth Conservation**: Reduces data transfer between services, improving response times
3. **Placement Flexibility**: Allows developers to download images exactly where they're needed
4. **Permission Management**: Avoids filesystem permission issues in restricted environments
5. **Workflow Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing development pipelines

This strategy enables AI agents to intelligently suggest the optimal download location based on project context, without being constrained by their own environment limitations.

### Minimizing Tool Spam and API Calls

Unlike other solutions that require multiple tool calls for searching, filtering, downloading, and attributing images, our server:

- **Unifies the entire image workflow** into a single `stock_photo` tool
- **Optimizes result retrieval** by requesting more images upfront to enable better filtering
- **Eliminates ping-pong interactions** between the agent and services
- **Reduces agent token usage** by streamlining request and response formats

This design significantly reduces the number of API calls and tool invocations, leading to faster results and lower operational costs.

## üîÑ Automatic Attribution and Compliance

### Unsplash Terms of Service: Effortless Compliance

Using images from Unsplash requires adherence to their [Terms of Service](https://unsplash.com/license). Our server handles this automatically:

1. **Attribution Data Capture**: Every image download automatically stores photographer information
2. **Metadata Embedding**: Photographer details are embedded directly into image files
3. **Attribution Database**: A local database maintains a record of all image usage
4. **Attribution Generators**: Built-in tools create HTML and React attribution components
5. **API Access**: Simple endpoints to retrieve attribution data for any project

By using our Unsplash Smart MCP Server, you are automatically compliant with Unsplash's requirements without any additional effort.

### Attribution Management System

The server includes a comprehensive attribution management system:

```javascript
// Retrieve attribution data for your project
const attributions = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/unsplash', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    method: 'get_attributions',
    params: {
      format: 'json',  // Options: json, html, react
      projectPath: '/path/to/your/project'
    }
  })
}).then(res => res.json());

// attributions contains complete data about every image used
```

The API can generate three types of attribution files:

1. **JSON**: Structured data for custom implementations
2. **HTML**: Ready-to-use HTML page for website footer or credits section
3. **React**: Drop-in React component for modern web applications

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Connection Refused** | Ensure the server is running on the configured port |
| **Authentication Error** | Verify your Unsplash API key is correctly set |
| **No Images Found** | Try broader search terms or check your search query |
| **Download Permission Issues** | Use `downloadMode: 'urls_only'` and manual download commands |
| **Docker Container Exits Prematurely** | Ensure you're using `CMD ["npm", "start"]` in your Dockerfile instead of directly running the TypeScript file with tsx. This ensures the server stays running in a Docker environment. |
| **Timeout Errors** | The default MCP timeout is 60 seconds, which may be insufficient for downloading larger images or processing multiple images. For image-heavy operations: 1) Process fewer images per request, 2) Use smaller image dimensions, 3) Consider using `urls_only` mode instead of auto-download, 4) Check network connectivity |
| **Attribution Not Found** | Verify the image was downloaded through the MCP server |
| **Unhandled MCP Errors** | If you see `"McpError: MCP error -32001: Request timed out"` errors, your request is likely taking too long. Break it into smaller operations or use the URLs-only approach |
